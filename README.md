# Exposure calculator
Calculates the values of the aperture and shutter speed based on the [Sunny f/16 rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_16_rule).  
I wrote it to calculate the correct values when photographing with film cameras. Therefore, a set of shutter speeds and apertures may not be sufficient for your case.  
## How to use
1. Set the brightness value based on the hints on the cards. Use swipes to select values.
2. Set the ISO value of the film.
3. Use the calculated shutter speed and aperture values to properly expose the frame.
